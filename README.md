# Musical Song DB
In this assignment, I built a linked list data structure for storing and organizing a musical song database that can be iterated/viewed/played in chronological order (insertion order), in alphabetical order (sorted based on the names of the songs), in duration time order (sorted based on the duration times of the songs), and in random order (known as shuffle mode). The songs with their duration times are read from an input file (i.e., “songs.txt”) and they are organized by using a singly linked list data structure in the program.

The details of the program are given below:
